but you should use only chars (a-zA-Z) and digits (0-9). Don't leave the default value

g3oyf98, p9ak85i, h398dgf and similar. Again, DO NOT USE these examples, just type some chars of your own!<br /><br />

the security number check. Setting this variable to 1 will enable
JunkMark<sup>TM</sup>, setting it to 0 will disable it. JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> calculates
probability of a message being SPAM and gives it a score between
0 (not SPAM) and 100 (SPAM). The higher the score the more likely the message is

</table>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save and close the settings.php file.<br><span class="dest">Don't forget to rename the entries.txt file to the name you set as $settings['logfile'] in settings.php!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to your FTP client and FTP to the public directory on your server (where the rest of your website is; usually "public_html", "www" or "site") and create a folder where you will install GBook.<br />
Example: /public_html/gbook
Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/gbook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload all GBook files to this folder. The "images" folder (all files in this folder) must be transferred in BINARY mode, other files in ASCII mode (refer to your FTP client instructions for details on how to set transfer mode properly).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that PHP scripts have permission to write to files banned_ip.txt and entries.txt (or the renamed file as set in<br />$settings['logfile']) - on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) these two files to 666 (rw-rw-rw).</p>
<p>If you have done all this your guestbook should work now. In your browser open your GBook, for example:<br />
  http://www.yourdomain.com/gbook/gbook.php and test it. You can delete messages by clicking the red [X] icon and entering your admin password.</p>
<p>You may edit header.txt and footer.txt files to add your own header and footer to the links page. You will have to use <b>full image URLs</b> in the code. For example instead of &lt;IMG SRC="images/image.jpg" ... &gt; use &lt;IMG SRC="http://www.yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg" ... &gt;! Same goes for any Javascripts or CSS files if you are calling them from within the header or footer.</p>

<h3 id="upgrade">Upgrading from previous versions</h3>

<p>To upgrade from a previous version to 1.6 follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>BACKUP your old Gbook</li>
  <li>Edit the new settings.php file (more info under "Installation") as new variables have been added</li>
  <li>Upload ALL files (including style.css!) to your server <b>except entries.txt file</b>.</li>
  <li>CHMOD file banned_ip.txt to 666 (rw-rw-rw)</li>
  <li>Test everything. All your current posts should stay intact.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<h2 id="help">&raquo; Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><span class="dest">PLEASE READ BEFORE ASKING</span> Since this script is free no support is guaranteed. You will find solutions for some common
problems below. If you can't get the script to work please go through this readme file again carefully and repeat the
installation step-by-step (also delete old files and folders from the server). Also please feel free to FIRST SEARCH for solutions
and then post any questions or problems you might have to <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a>!</p>

<h3>1. What is CHMOD and FTP?</h3>

<p>I have prepared a simple <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php" target="_blank">
FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a> which will help you FTP files to your server and
set correct CHMOD settings.</p>

<h3>2. My guestbook doesn't work, HELP!</h3>

<p>Here are a few things to check:</p>
<ol>
  <li>did you upload the images folder in BINARY mode and all other files ASCII mode?</li>
  <li>did you upload the entries.txt file and RENAMED it to the name you set as $settings['logfile'] in settings.php</li>
  <li>are entries.txt (or the file named as set under $settings['logfile'] in settings.php) and banned_ip.txt files world writable? CHMOD them to 666 (rw-rw-rw) if you are on a UNIX server</li>
  <li>if images don't display correctly check if you uploaded them (the entire "images" folder) correctly. The images folder must be place within the guestbook folder, for example http://www.yourdomain.com/guestbook/images</li>
  <li>go through the entire setup process again carefully</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. The security number image/text doesn't work (show up)?</h3>
<p>For the image to work your server must have GD library installed. You can test if your server supports all the required
functions by uploading the <b>gd_test.php</b> file to your server and open it in your browser. If you get an error
when opening gd_test.php you should either ask your hosting company to install the GD library for PHP or
try with $settings['autosubmit'] set to 2. This will display the security number in text format
which is not as effective but better than nothing.</p>

<p>If you get the red WORKS image but the security image still doesn't work you probably
have problems with sessions. Ask your hosting company to check PHP sessions configuration.
Same thing if $settings['autosubmit'] set to 2 doesn't work.</p>

<h3>4. I installed GBook but I still get many SPAM messages?</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the latest version of GBook and that you have variables <b>$settings['autosubmit']</b> set to 1 or 2 and <b>$settings['junkmark_use']</b> set to 1. Also make sure the variable <b>$settings['junkmark_limit']</b> is not set too high or too low (recommended value is 60) and that you have changed variable <b>$settings['filter_sum']</b> as explained under Installation.</p>

<h3>5. May I use JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> SPAM filter in my other scripts?</h3>
<p>No, you are not allowed to use JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> SPAM filter in any other script (commercial or open source) without my express written permission. It may only be used in GBook and scripts that are direct derivates of GBook (customized/modified versions).</p>

<h3>6. How can I ban an IP address?</h3>
<p>Select &quot;Ban IP address&quot; when deleting a post or viewing IP address from GBook.</p>

<p>You can manually ban an IP address by adding <b><i>IP</i>%</b> to the banned_ip.txt file. For example to ban IP 123.123.123.123 add this to the banned_ip.txt file:<br />
123.123.123.123%</p>

<p>You don't have to put it in a new line, IPs can be listed like this:<br />
123.123.123.123%321.321.321.321%111.111.111.111%

<h3>7. How can I remove an IP address from ban?</h3>

<p>Open banned_ip.txt, find and delete the IP address you wish to stop banning, save changes and you're done!</p>

<h2 id="translate">&raquo; Translating GBook to your language</h2>

<p>As of version 1.6 GBook comes with a language file which makes translating GBook to other languages easily.</p>

<p>To translate GBook to your language follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate file <b>language.inc.php</b> and open it in a plain text editor like Notepad or Wordpad.</li>
<li>Save the file as <b>yourlanguage.inc.php</b> (deutsch.inc.php, francais.inc.php, ...).</li>
<li>Edit the language file header (first lines that start with *) with your information. Please follow the provided format.</li>
<li>Translate all lines containing language. You may translate <b>only the right side of each line</b>, for example:<br /><br />
$t['DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS']='TRANSLATE WORDS HERE';<br /><br />
<p><span class="dest">When translating make sure to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>keep the line format: single quotes (') around each phrase and lines must end with a semi-colon (;)</li>
<li>if you use single quotes in the words escape them with a backslash (\). WRONG: can't CORRECT: can\'t</li>
<li>do not change these codes as they are used by GBook: %s %d</li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
<li>Save the file and upload it to your server.</li>
<li>Edit the <b>$settings['language']</b> setting in your settings.php and upload the modified file to your server.</li>
<li>Test GBook with your language and make sure it works ok.</li>
<li>If possible you should also translate this readme.htm file (please name it <b>readme-yourlanguage.htm</b>, for example readme-fr.htm, readme-de.htm, ...).</li>

<h2 id="badwords">&raquo; Adding / Translating bad words list</h2>

<p>As of version 1.2 GBook can search for bad words in the comments and replace them with ****. Files with bad words list are stored in folder "badwords" and have two letter names. For now only English version is available (named "en.php").</p>
<p><b>Before adding new words please install GBook and test it so you are sure it works properly!</b></p>
<p>To add new bad words open the en.php file in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor), find the comment saying INSERT NEW BAD WORDS BELOW THIS LINE and add new bad words in this format:<br />
  <br />
"BADWORD" =&gt; "REPLACEMENT",<br />
  <br />
  For example if "asfhkjhfasf" is a bad word you would add this line to the file:<br />
  <br />
"asfhkjhfasf" =&gt; "a**********",<br />
  <br />
  Don't forget to add a comma ( , ) after the line!</p>
<p>If you are translating the bad words file I suggest you leave the English words and add new ones in your language as explained above. Then save the file as two letter country code php file. For example, if you are translating the file in French, you should save the file as <b>fr.php</b> (CaSe SeNSiTiVe!). Upload fr.php to your "badwords" folder, go to settings.php again and set <b>$settings['filter_lang']</b> to <b>"fr"</b> (file name without .php).</p>
<p>Now test the GBook again. If you get an Error or Warning when you try to post a new message this means something is wrong with your language file. It either can't be found (check the name of the file, on most servers names are CaSe SeNsiTiVe!) or something is wrong with PHP syntax in it (make sure all the words are added in<br />
  <b>"BADWORD" =&gt; "REPLACEMENT",</b> syntax).</p>
<p><b>Please send me the translated file</b>. If you translate the bad words file to your language please send it to info AT phpjunkyard DOT com (or contact me through PHPJunkard.com contact form) and I will make it available to others for download. You may include your name, website URL and e-mail address and I will give you proper credit (translated by John Doe. Visit www.yourwebsite.com).</p>
